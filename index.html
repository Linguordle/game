    <h1>Welcome to Linguordle!</h1>
    <p>
        Linguordle is a game that lets you test your knowledge of the genetic relationships between languages.
        Every time you guess, the game tells you the closest shared classification between your guess and the answer. 
        There's a new language to guess every day, and you're told the language family of the target language as a hint to get started.
    </p>
    <p><i>
        Languages include only living, non-isolate, non-artificial languages from Glottolog.
        Some aspects of the game take inspiration from <a href="https://metazooa.com/">Metazooa by Trainwreck Labs.</a>
